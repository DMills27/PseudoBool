Lately, I've been thinking a lot about [psudeo-boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Boolean_function) constraint solvers. I first came across them while perusing Anders Kaseorg's [answer](https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-maximise-pairings-for-12-golfers-playing-3-rounds/answer/Anders-Kaseorg) on Quora about a nice combinatorial optimisation problem. I couldn't help but think about the many other types of combinatorial optimisation problems a generalisation of his method would solve. And so naturally, I decided to play with them. These [two](http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/jsat/content/volume2/JSAT2_1_Een.pdf) [papers](http://www.aloul.net/Papers/faloul_tc07.pdf) have been particularly useful in helping me with this endeavour.
